    -   Write in one format (Markdown), convert to many formats (PDF, HTML, ODT,
        DOCX, and more)
    -   Style HTML output with CSS and PDF output with a custom \LaTeX\ header
    -   Use a simple pre-processor to define per-format operations on the
        Markdown input or its parts, such as moving contact information to the

    -   Use a text-based resumé when needed in a pinch
